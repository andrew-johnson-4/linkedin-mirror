# Dependent Types

Dependent types are a feature of type theory that allow types to depend on values. 
In traditional type systems, types describe the shape and structure of values, 
but they do not contain any information about the values themselves. 
In contrast, dependent types enable types to capture more precise information about the behavior and properties of values.

For example, in a dependent type system, 
it is possible to define a type that represents a list of a certain length, 
where the length is determined by a value. 
The type of a list of length n would then be represented as a dependent type that depends on the value of n. 
Similarly, it is possible to define a type that represents a vector of a certain dimension, 
where the dimension is also determined by a value.
