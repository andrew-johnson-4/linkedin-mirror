# Network File System

Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol that enables clients to access files and 
directories located on remote servers as if they were on the client's local file system. 
NFS was originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1980s and has since become a widely used protocol in Unix and Linux environments.

NFS allows users and applications to access files over a network as if they were accessing files on a local disk.
