# NLP Ensemble Consensus

Ensemble consensus in Natural Language Processing refers to a technique that involves combining the predictions of 
multiple NLP models or algorithms to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the system.

Ensemble methods are based on the idea that multiple models can perform better than a single model, 
especially when the individual models are diverse and complementary in their strengths and weaknesses. 
By combining the predictions of multiple models, 
ensemble methods can reduce the impact of individual errors and produce more reliable and accurate results.
