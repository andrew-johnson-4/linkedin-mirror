# Refinement Types

In type theory, a refinement type is a type that is defined as a subset of another type, 
where the subset is specified by a logical predicate.

In other words, a refinement type is a type that has additional constraints beyond the basic 
constraints imposed by its underlying type. 
The constraints are expressed as logical formulas that define a subset of the values that belong to the underlying type.
