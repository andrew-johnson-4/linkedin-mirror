# Rope Data Structure

In computer science, a Rope is a data structure used for efficiently manipulating and storing large text strings. 
It is a Binary Tree where each leaf node contains a small piece of the complete string. 
The term "rope" comes from the idea of the tree structure resembling a rope or cord, 
where the small pieces of string stored in the leaves are the individual strands that make up the rope.
