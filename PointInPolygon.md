# Determine whether a Point is contained within a Polygon

To determine whether a point is contained within a polygon, you can use the following algorithm:

1. Choose a point known to be outside the polygon and draw a horizontal line through the given point.
2. Count the number of times the line intersects with the polygon.
3. If the number of intersections is odd, then the point is inside the polygon. If the number of intersections is even, then the point is outside the polygon.
